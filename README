# PYTHIA8 simulation for ILC HZ to strange quarks
#
# ilchz.cc, ilchz.h: C++ pythia code, including ROOT
#                    analysis code
#
# ilchz.cmnd: pythia configuration input file
#
# COMPILATION:
#  Change all the pythia and root related variables in order
#  to point the installed paths, and 
#
#  $ make [-jX] ilchz
#
#  Requires Pythia8.2 and ROOT (>5.32)
#
# 
# LAUNCH:
#  $ ilchz [OPTIONS] ilchz.cmnd [> out.txt]
# 
# Simulate the generation of the e+ e- --> H0 Z0 --> s sbar s sbar 
# process (defined in the 'ilchz.cmnd' input file, so in principal
# can be changed but the persistency makes no sense no longer) using
# the Pythia8.2 library. A n-tuple is created (called 'mctrue') 
# containing the following info:
#    'pdgId'      : std::vector<int> of the PDG ID code of the stored particle
#    'motherindex': std::vector<int> of the n-tuple vector index of the mother
#                   Note that -1 is used when the particle is the FS hadrons
#    'catchall'   : std::vector<int> a multi-use variable, changing its meaning
#                   depending the type of the particle:
#             * 0                  for the resonance (H,Z)
#             * is higher p quark? for the s-squark resonance daughters
#             * grandmother PDG_ID for the 'final state' strange hadrons
#    'p'          : std::vector<float> momentum of the particle
#    'pmother'    : std::vector<float> momentum of its mother [to be deprecated]
#    'phi'        : std::vector<float> phi of the particle
#    'theta'      : std::vector<float> theta of the particle
#Note that the p,phi,theta variables are respect the rest-frame of the q-qbar system
#in the case of the final-state hadrons, as well as the pmother
#
#[OPTIONS]
#    -o name of the ROOT output file [hzkin.root]
#    -p flag to keep final state PIONS instead of KAONS (default)
#    -h show this help
#
